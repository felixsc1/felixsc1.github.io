Hi, you found my website! I just wanted to try out the github pages feature. When I have time, I will add some more blog posts or infos about projects on this site.
Meanwhile, just check out my github repositories for some work examples.

I've completed a PhD in Neuroscience at the ETH Zurich and gained lots of experience in preclinical magnetic resonance imaging, data processing and analysis. Recently, I am mainly interested in machine learning, big data, blockchain, and any "disruptive technologies".
